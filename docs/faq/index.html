<b>How do I login to Credentials Manager?</b>

</p>

To login to Credentials Manager, use your Active Directory (AD) username and password.

</p>

<b>How do I request a new Active Directory Group and/or AD user to access credentials in AURA?</b>

</p>

To request access for a new group or user, ask your manager to submit a User MAC request in Remedy. Approval by a
first-line manager is required. See <a class="uk-link-muted" uri="authorization">Authorization</a> for a brief
explanation of how authorization works in Aura as well as <a class="uk-link-muted" uri="access-process">Access Request Process</a>
for the steps involved in gaining access to Aura.

</p>

<b>What's the difference between Secret and Credential?</b>

</p>

Nothing. These are synonymous. The term <i>secret</i> comes up in the context of Thycotic Secret Server. Secrets in this
product are individually named sets of <i>sensitive information</i> derived from secret templates. Flexibility in templates
allows secrets to represent a very broad spectrum of <i>secure data</i>. In Secret Server, all secret field information is
securely and individually encrypted.

</p>

The term <i>credential</i> is used interchangeably with secret, but a credential is narrower in scope than
a secret in the sense that a credential is a form of identity that provides authentication and authorization
into a digital platform. Examples of credentials include usernames and passwords, API keys, application tokens, SSH keys,
SSL certificates, etc. As such, a credential is a kind of secret because it is modeled in Secret Server through a secret
template.

</p>

In AURA, Credentials API performs the translation between the two concepts, because on the way out (GET), it retrieves
secrets from Secret Server and uses the secure data returned to form and to represent a credential in a response. On
the way in (POST), Credentials API accepts credential data and converts it into a secret to be vaulted securely in
Secret Server.

</p>

<b>Where is the documentation for Credentials API?</b>

</p>

An interactive Swagger UI is available in the following environments:

</p>

<table class="table">
    <th>Credentials API</th><th>Direct Link</th>
    <tr>
        <td>Dev</td>
        <td>Dev</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Stg</td>
        <td>Stg</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Prd</td>
        <td>Prd</td>
    </tr>
</table>

</p>

<b>How do I login to Secret Server?</b>

</p>

The Secret Server Web UI is available in the following environments:

</p>

<table class="table">
    <th>Secret Server</th><th>Direct Link</th>
    <tr>
        <td>Dev</td>
        <td>Dev</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Stg</td>
        <td>Stg</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Prd</td>
        <td>Prd</td>
    </tr>
</table>

</p>

Direct access to the Secret Server Web UI is restricted to <i>authorized group members only</i>.

</p>

Primarily, The Secret Server Web UI is intended to be used by Deployment Engineers who are authorized in the SS_SIE_Global AD Group for machine platform on-boarding, to create Secret Templates, configure Remote Password Changers, enable password rotation and lifecycle management, as well as to on-board customer devices into Secret Server by creating and/or discovering elevated credentials on managed devices.

</p>

On-boarding projects require the participation of an authorized Secret Server user. As such, contact a Deployment Engineer,
someone in the SS_SIE_Global AD group, to step through the PAM Designer Workflow for your project.

</p>

<b>How is a credential in AURA associated with a specific Customer? or Device? or Digital Platform?</b>

</p>

Credentials in Aura are always associated with a Customer ID and/or Device ID. As such, they can be matched up using one
or the other or both as parameters to retrieve credentials through Credentials API. For example, static device credentials
are based upon a standard secret template that includes a field to specify the CustomerId, DeviceId, as well as
Machine Platform, e.g., QRadar, Resilient, etc.

</p>

See the <a class="uk-link-muted" uri="design">Design</a> step of the PAM Designer Workflow for a list of standard
secret template fields.
