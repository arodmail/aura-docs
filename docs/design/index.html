The design step of the PAM on-boarding workflow takes input from <a class="uk-link-muted"  href="discover">Discovery</a> to produce a
design for: 1) Secret Template and 2) Remote Password Changer (RPC). These tasks are integral to the on-boarding
workflow because the designs solve fundamental on-boarding problems. Greater precision in the design step increases the
likelihood of success in the later steps of the workflow.

</p>

<h3 class="uk-h3 tm-heading-fragment">1. Secret Template Design</h3>

A template in Secret Server is like a schema for a secret. As such, a secret template defines fields
and field types to represent and to store a secret

</p></p>

The following <i>standard</i> fields should be included in a secret template:

</p></p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th></th><th>Field Name</th><th>Field Type</th><th>Field Description</th><th>Required</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>HostIP</td><td>Text</td><td>IP address of the digital platform, device, or host under management</td><td>For RPC</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>LoginName</td><td>Text</td><td>A username for a credential</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>Password</td><td>Password</td><td>The password associated with the LoginName</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>CustomerId</td><td>Text</td><td>A unique ID assigned to the customer of the digital platform</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td><td>DeviceId</td><td>Text</td><td>A unique ID assigned to an instance of the digital platform</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>6</td><td>MachinePlatform</td><td>Text</td><td>A name to identify the digital platform</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7</td><td>Hostname</td><td>Text</td><td>A network name of the host for the credential</td><td>For WebUI</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td><td>CustomerName</td><td>Text</td><td>Customer name</td><td>For WebUI</td></tr>
    <tr><td>9</td><td>OperatingSystem</td><td>Text</td><td>The operating system of the host (if applicable)</td><td>No</td></tr>
</table>

</p>

<h4 class="uk-h3 tm-heading-fragment">1.1 Template Design Considerations</h4>

For AURA (through Secret Server) to manage credentials on a digital platform, device, host, OS, application, or other
remote customer asset, a secret template can be associated with an RPC, and a "heartbeat" can be enabled. A heartbeat
tests a login to verify, on an interval, that the password value stored in a secret matches the password value on the
target host. A heartbeat doesn't make sense for static or controlled credentials because they do not have a connection
to a remote host.

</p>

Other design considerations for templates include:

</p>

<b>Custom Fields for RPC</b>

</p>

When secret templates are designed for dynamic or functional credentials, they are each associated with a remote password
changer because, by definition, the password value for dynamic credentials must change automatically after each use
(upon check-in) and for functional credentials the password value must change on a regular interval (upon expiration).
As such, a secret template for dynamic credentials, or functional, must define a 1:1 relationship to an RPC.

</p>

A custom field in a secret template may be given to an RPC as a variable. A design for a secret template, then, may
combine standard fields with custom fields that are determined in discovery as needed to perform a password change in the
digital platform. For example:

</p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th></th><th>Field Name</th><th>Field Type</th><th>Field Description</th><th>Required</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>10</td><td>LoginType</td><td>Text</td><td>One of <code>Root</code>, <code>Web</code>, or <code>CLI</code></td><td>No</td></tr>
</table>

</p>

A secret template that is extended like this to include a custom "LoginType" field, may give the field value to the RPC.
This allows password changes to be performed by the RPC in a slightly different way for <code>Root</code> accounts, for
example, than for <code>CLI</code> accounts. In cases where a different sequence of commands must be executed by an RPC
to change the password, based upon LoginType, a secret template may be designed with one or more custom fields to be
used as input to an RPC.

</p>

<b>Custom Fields for Full-Text Search</b>

</p>

Other use cases in which to expand a secret template with custom fields include the need to retrieve credentials by specific
field values (full-text searches), above and beyond the standard fields, through the Credentials API for platform
integration purposes.

</p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th></th><th>Field Name</th><th>Field Type</th><th>Field Description</th><th>Required</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>11</td><td>Level</td><td>Text</td><td>One of <code>One</code>, <code>Two</code>, or <code>Three</code></td><td>No</td></tr>
</table>

</p>

In this example, a secret template is expanded to include a "Level" field that indicates a level of access
granted to the credential in the digital platform. In this overly simplified example, a secret template design provides
applications that are authorized to retrieve credentials from the Credentials API with options to retrieve using one of
the three or a combination of possible values for this custom field: <code>One</code>, <code>Two</code>, or
<code>Three</code>

</p>

<b>Relationship to Password Complexity Rules</b>

</p>

A secret template defines a schema for a credential also in the sense that it establishes a 1:1 relationship to password
complexity rules. A secret template may be associated with unique password rules in case these are slightly different
from one digital platform to another, and as such, the password value <i>generated</i> for a secret created from the
template will follow these rules, as defined.

</p>

<b>Outcome of Task</b>

<ul>
    <li>Define fields and field types to represent and to store a secret: design a Secret Template</li>
    <li>Determine the need for custom fields for RPC and/or for full-text search via Credentials API</li>
    <li>Compare password complexity rules discovered in the digital platform to built-in Secret Server rules</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="uk-h3 tm-heading-fragment">2. Remote Password Changer (RPC) Design</h3>

For credentials that require passwords to change automatically, a remote password changer provides a mechanism to
establish a connection to the digital platform and to change password values on credentials remotely. A remote password
changer is usually associated with a specific secret template. The second step during design in the PAM on-boarding
workflow determines an approach to provide automated remote password change, for credentials that require it.

</p>

There are 3 possible approaches to take:

</p>

<b>A. Built-In</b> - Select a built-in, out-of-box RPC from Secret Server</br>
<b>B. Custom</b> - Define an algorithm, commands, and error handling for a custom RPC</br>
<b>C. PowerShell</b> - Write a script, for password changes that call for loops and multi-condition if-then-else statements

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">A. Built-In RPC</h4>

The most convenient approach is to select a built-in RPC. The following remote password changers are available
to be selected for the following digital platforms, applications, operating systems, cloud-hosted resources, device types
and/or hosts:

</p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th></th><th>Built-In RPC</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>Active Directory Account</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>Amazon IAM Console Password Privileged Account</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>Amazon IAM Key</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>Blue Coat Account Custom (SSH)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td><td>Blue Coat Enable Password Custom (SSH)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>6</td><td>Cisco Account Custom (SSH)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td><td>Cisco Enable Secret Custom (SSH)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>10</td><td>Custom Password Changer</td></tr>
    <tr><td>11</td><td>ESX/ESXi (API)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>12</td><td>F5 BIG-IP Root Account (SSH)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>13</td><td>Generic Discovery-Only Credentials</td></tr>
    <tr><td>14</td><td>Generic ODBC (DataSource)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>15</td><td>HP iLO Account Custom (SSH)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>16</td><td>IBM iSeries Mainframe</td></tr>
    <tr><td>17</td><td>Juniper Account Custom (SSH)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>18</td><td>LDAP (Active Directory)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>19</td><td>LDAP (DSEE)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>20</td><td>LDAP (OpenLDAP)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>21</td><td>MSS_CiscoFW</td></tr>
    <tr><td>22</td><td>MySQL Account</td></tr>
    <tr><td>23</td><td>Office365</td></tr>
    <tr><td>24</td><td>Oracle Account</td></tr>
    <tr><td>25</td><td>Oracle Account (AS SYS)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>26</td><td>Oracle Account (DataSource)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>27</td><td>PostgreSQL Account (x64)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>28</td><td>PowerShell Script</td></tr>
    <tr><td>29</td><td>SAP Account</td></tr>
    <tr><td>30</td><td>SonicWall NSA Web Admin Account</td></tr>
    <tr><td>31</td><td>SonicWall NSA Web Local User Account</td></tr>

    <tr><td>33</td><td>SSH Key Rotation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>34</td><td>SSH Key Rotation (No Password)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>35</td><td>SSH Key Rotation Privileged Account</td></tr>
    <tr><td>36</td><td>SSH Key Rotation Privileged Account (No Password)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>37</td><td>Sybase Account</td></tr>
    <tr><td>38</td><td>Test Password Changer</td></tr>
    <tr><td>39</td><td>Unix Account (SSH)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>41</td><td>Unix Account Custom (SSH)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>43</td><td>Unix Account SU Takeover (SSH)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>44</td><td>Unix Account SUDO Takeover (SSH)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>45</td><td>Unix Root Account Custom (SSH)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>46</td><td>WatchGuard Custom (SSH)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>47</td><td>Web User Account</td></tr>
    <tr><td>48</td><td>Windows Account</td></tr>
    <tr><td>49</td><td>z/OS Mainframe</td></tr>
</table>

</p>

Built-in RPCs have the advantage of being included standard in Secret Server. As such built-in remote password changers
are expected to have been tested and can be used reliably in a stable production environment. If the on-boarding for a
digital platform matches one of the built-in RPCs above, then this saves time during implementation and validation.
Processing by a built-in password changer is done through internal commands. The commands cannot be edited. Standard
protocols and port numbers are used by built-in RPCs. For example, "Unix Account (SSH)" uses SSH and port 22.

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">B. Custom RPC</h4>

If the built-in RPCs do not provide a match for the digital platform to be on-boarded, then a Custom RPC may be turned
into the right fit. A basic command-line custom password changer defines a sequence of commands to execute, in order,
as well as pauses after each command, to allow for processing time on the remote system. For example, on a Linux
or Unix system, for a password change to be performed by a Custom RPC, the following RPC design is expected to be compatible
with the target platform:

</p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Order</th><th>Command</th><th>Comment</th><th>Pause (MS)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td><code>passwd</code></td><td>Password Command</td><td>2000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td><code>$CURRENTPASSWORD</code></td><td>Current Password</td><td>2000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td><code>$NEWPASSWORD</code></td><td>New Password</td><td>2000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td><code>$NEWPASSWORD</code></td><td>Confirmed Password</td><td>2000</td></tr>
</table>

</p>

The Custom RPC connects to the target system over SSH, using the <code>HostIP</code> value in the secret as well as the
<code>LoginName</code> and <code>Password</code>. Change password follows the order of commands defined by the Custom RPC
and provides the input required at each prompt:

</p>

<pre>
$ passwd
Changing password for user
(current) UNIX password: $CURRENTPASSWORD
Enter new UNIX password: $NEWPASSWORD
Retype new UNIX password: $NEWPASSWORD
passwd: password updated successfully
</pre>

</p>

The <code>passwd</code> command prompts for the user's current password, if one is present. This password is then
encrypted and compared against the stored password. After the password has been entered, password aging information is
checked to see if the user is permitted to change the password at this time. If not, <code>passwd</code> refuses to
change the password and exits.

</p>

The RPC is then prompted twice for a new password. The second entry is compared against the first and both are required
to match in order for the password to be changed.

</p>

Then, the password is tested for complexity on the target host. The new password, the value of <code>$NEWPASSWORD</code>
variable given to the Custom RPC at password change time, is <i>generated</i> based upon the password complexity rules
associated with the secret template, which are expected to match the password rules on the host. In this case, because
the platform allows a user to change their own password to self-service an account, and the new password value is strong,
the Custom RPC is successful.
