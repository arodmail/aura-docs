Aura Docs provides a step-by-step guide for PAM on-boarding projects. The guide focuses on a workflow. A goal of the documentation is to define a process that integrates a customer's digital platform with the Aura sub-system. This guide is divided into five sections: 1) Overview, 2) Workflow, 3) Developer, 4) What's New, and 5) FAQ.

<h3 class="uk-h3 tm-heading-fragment">PAM Designer Workflow</h3>

The Privileged Access Management (PAM) Designer Workflow starts with the discovery of a Digital Platform. In this step,
a platform is examined from the perspective of the access required by an MSSP to provide services to customers.

<h3>What is a Digital Platform?</h3>

It's a broader concept than machine platform in the sense that a Digital Platform is any environment that hosts workloads for
customers. Digital platform includes machines, devices, applications, OSes, cloud-hosted resources, and other customer assets
that are exposed as manageable PAM endpoints. Digital platforms include software and technology used in business operations
and IT systems. A digital platform often serves as a company's backbone for operations and customer engagement. Services,
solutions, tools, systems and interfaces comprise a digital platform.

<h3>What is AURA?</h3>

AURA stands for <i>Access to User Resources Architecture</i>, an integrated system that provides privileged access management
for digital platforms. As an integration of cooperating components, a common goal of the system is to provision,
monitor, and audit the use of elevated credentials. AURA includes a highly secure credentials vault to store
credentials that grant the access needed by an MSSP to perform routine, authorized activities in support of business-critical
operations, in a secure manner.

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">Workflow Steps</h4>

<h4>Discover</h4>

Step one in the worklow is <a class="uk-link-muted" uri="discover">Discover</a>, an assessment of a digital platform focused on
credentials to manage. Discovery creates or gains access to a Test Environment, an instance of the digital platform.

</p></p>

<h4>Design</h4>

The <a class="uk-link-muted" uri="design">Design</a> stage of the workflow designs secret templates and remote password changers (RPCs). During
design, decisions are made about how to represent a credential to manage, and how to change passwords remotely.

<h4>Implement</h4>

The <a class="uk-link-muted" uri="implement">Implement</a> step takes design input to create secret templates, remote password changers, as well
as secrets (credentials) in the PAM system (Secret Server). Implementation uses the AURA development environment.

<h4>Validate</h4>

In the <a class="uk-link-muted" uri="validate">Validate</a> stage of the workflow, secret templates are exported from a development environment and
then imported into a staging environment for end-to-end testing and verification.

<h4>Deploy</h4>

The <a class="uk-link-muted" uri="deploy">Deploy</a> stage goes live by moving credentials into a production environment for authorized use
by applications and users. Once credentials from a customer's digital platform are moved into production, and configured
based on access requirements, then the PAM on-boarding workflow is complete.

</p></p>

<h3 class="uk-h3 tm-heading-fragment">Credential Categories</h3>

Credentials in AURA can be distinguished by category. One of the main differences between credential categories is the
expected consumer. While <i>static</i> and <i>functional</i> credentials are mostly consumed by applications for
integration and automation purposes, <i>dynamic</i> and <i>controlled</i> credentials are expected to be consumed by
people for administrative purposes. Functional, dynamic, and controlled credentials are rotated by RPCs but on different
intervals. Dynamic and controlled credentials rotate upon use (upon check-in), and functional credentials rotate
yearly, automatically when they expire. Static credentials are not expected to change.

</p></p></p></p>

<div align="center" style="padding-top: 15px;padding-bottom: 50px;"><img src="images/credential-categories.png" width="850"/></div>

A credential from a digital platform to be managed by AURA, must belong to one of the categories:

</p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>&nbsp;</th><th>Category</th><th>Description</th><th>RPC Required</th><th>Auto Change</th><th>Check-Out Enabled</th><th>Credentials Manager</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>Dynamic</td><td>Enabled for check-in/out, supports automated remote password rotation </td>
            <td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>Static</td><td>A vaulted credential, does not change frequently or automatically </td>
            <td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>Controlled</td><td>Stored securely, supports manual password rotation </td>
        <td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>Functional</td><td>Like static, but supports automated remote password rotation </td>
            <td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr>
</table>

</p>

<b>Note:</b> <i>Auto Change</i> automatically initiates a password change after a Credential expires.

<h3 class="uk-h3 tm-heading-fragment">Adapt It</h3>

There are many different ways of approaching new projects. This is a proposed PAM process, but it encourages teams to
think about and tailor the process into something that works for them. There is no magic one-size-fits-all way to get
through a project and achieve awesome results every time. Good design processes are both strong and flexible. This one
is intended to allow teams to take on any PAM on-boarding challenge and to increase their chances of success by using the
workflow steps as guides, not exact recipes.
