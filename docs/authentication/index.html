When an application sends a request to an Aura API, the API first <i>authenticates</i> a user, then <i>authorizes</i>
the request. This section describes authentication mechanisms supported by APIs and explains some differences.
Through a RBAC (Role Based Access Control) model, strong API security prevents unauthorized access to highly sensitive
credentials and provides assurances that only authorized access to credentials is granted. Read this section to learn how
to integrate an application securely with Aura APIs.

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">1. Basic Authentication</h4>

To authenticate with an API, use <b>HTTP Basic Authentication</b>, where an HTTP header containing a username and a password are
separated by a colon and the combined string value is Base64 encoded, then prefixed by the word "Basic " and a space.
This value is sent to an Aura API in an HTTP header called "Authorization".

</p></p>

For example, to send a request to Credentials API, use HTTP Basic Authentication with <code>curl</code>, specify the
Active Directory username and password in a <code>-u</code> parameter. Active Directory users are recognized by an
"admin\" prefix prepended to a username.

<pre>
curl -X GET -u 'admin\username:password' "https://pam.sec.ibm.com/credentials-api/credentials/"
</pre>

This request generates the following HTTP request Headers, note the "Authorization" header and Base64 encoded value:

<pre>
> GET /credentials-api/credentials/ HTTP/1.1
> Host: pam.sec.ibm.com
> Authorization: Basic YWRtaW5cdXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200
</pre>

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">2. Bearer Authentication</h4>

<i>Bearer Authentication will be supported in a future release and is recommended for high performance applications</i>

<p>


The <b>Bearer Authentication</b> scheme can be used as an alternative to Basic Authentication. Generally, before an
application can get a response from an API, it must first authenticate using its own credentials. In Bearer Authentication,
an AD user is verified against Active Directory, and their username/password are exchanged for an access token. The
access token represents a scope, a duration, and grants access to the same credentials that are granted to the AD user.
An application that authenticates using this scheme may send requests to APIs by presenting an access token.


</p></p>

To exchange AD username and password for an access token, an application sends a request to the
<a class="uk-link-muted"  target="_blank">Credentials API</a> <code>/login</code> endpoint:

<pre>
curl -v -X POST https://pam.sec.ibm.com/credentials-api/login?user=username -d 'password'
</pre>

The response headers include an <code>access_token</code> header that contains the token value:

<pre>
< HTTP/1.1 200
< Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=2265B47C487DC015CD155295EC379EF9; Path=/; HttpOnly
< access_token: {token_value}
< Access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type, api_key, Authorization
< Date: Wed, 31 Dec 2030 23:59:59 GMT
< Access-control-allow-methods: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS
< Access-control-allow-origin: *
< Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
< Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location
< Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
< Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000
</pre>

To present a token using the Bearer Authentication scheme, an application sends an HTTP header called "Authorization" in
which the value is prefixed by the word "Bearer " a space, followed by the token value:

<pre>
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer {token_value}" https://pam.sec.ibm.com/credentials-api/credentials/
</pre>

A token is valid for a short time period (20 minutes), and its use eliminates the need to verify an AD user against
Active Directory on each and every request. Bypassing AD user validation by using a token has huge performance benefits.
For this reason, Bearer Authentication is recommended for high volume applications, for example, applications that
poll for credentials on short intervals. The recommended approach to authenticate in these cases is for the application
to loop over steps 1 and 2:

</p></p>

<pre>
1) exchange AD username/password for an access token
2) use the token until it expires
</pre>

</p></p>

When a token expires, the response code from a request sent to an API is <code>401</code> and the response body
is expected to be:

<pre>
{
  "timestamp": "2030-12-31T23:59:59.000+00:00",
  "status": 401,
  "error": "Unauthenticated",
  "message": "Expired Token",
  "path": "/credentials"
}
</pre>

</p></p></p></p>
