Access to credentials in Aura is granted or denied to an AD user by their membership in an Active Directory Group. Through AD
synchronization, when an application sends a request to an Aura API, the API authorizes the request through Secret Server.
A goal of AD synchronization is to selectively place members of group types into Secret Server to be authorized at a higher
or a lower level in a secure folder structure.

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">1. Folder Structure</h4>

A higher level in the folder structure is reserved for applications to retrieve credentials from Aura programmatically, for example,
to retrieve API tokens used for device monitoring and other automation purposes. A mid-level in the folder structure is
intended to authorize Deployment Engineers for digital platform on-boarding into the PAM solution, (to create Secret
Templates, configure Remote Password Changers, enable password rotation and lifecycle management), as well as to on-board
customer devices into Secret Server by creating and/or discovering elevated credentials on managed devices. A lower
level in the folder structure is where SOC Analysts are authorized and limited to access only the credentials they need
for their day-to-day operational needs.

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">2. Folder Roots</h4>

The purpose of root nodes in the folder structure is to securely store credential categories:

</p></p>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th></th><th>Root Name</th><th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>Dynamic</td><td>Credentials that require check-in/out and automated remote password rotation</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>Static</td><td>Vaulted credentials that do not change frequently or automatically</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>Controlled</td><td>Credentials to store securely, allow manual password rotation</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td><td>Functional</td><td>Like static, but supports automated remote password rotation </td></tr>
</table>

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">3. Group Types</h4>

Members of group types A, B, and C are recognized by Aura by their AD username/password.

</p></p>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Group Type</th><th>Members</th><th>Count (estimated)</th><th>Authorization Level</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>Group Type A</td><td>Deployment Engineers</td><td>25</td><td>Cross Customer</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Group Type B</td><td>SOC Analysts</td><td>430</td><td>Single Platform or Cross Platform</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Group Type C</td><td>Applications and Services</td><td>5</td><td>Global</td></tr>
</table>

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">4. Active Directory Synchronization</h4>

When AD synchronization runs, it maps members of group type A into Local User Accounts in Secret Server. These users
are authenticated by AD username/password and granted access to the Secret Server web console for administrative purposes.

</p></p>

Members of any group type B and C are mapped by AD synchronization into Application User Accounts in Secret Server. These
users are also authenticated by AD username/password, but are not allowed to access the Secret Server web console. The members
of any group type B are typically issued a short-lived OAuth token through their AD username/password., on-demand, in order for
the system to make REST API calls into Secret Server on their behalf. As such, any password view, list, check-out,
check-in, or other activity by a member of group type B or C is fully tracked and audited by the system through an
OAuth token, per REST API call.

</p></p>

In some scenarios, members of group type A are not precluded from being issued an OAuth token by the system in order
to make Secret Server REST API calls on their behalf. As such, while members of group type A typically use the Secret
Server web console directly, they may also make use of Aura Credentials Migration API and/or Credentials API to perform
their deployment engineering role. Members of group type A may also use the Credentials Manager Web UI for password
check-in/check-out, as needed.

</p></p>

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">5. Permissions</h4>

Folder permissions apply to the members of each group type:

</p></p>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2"></th><th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">Folder Permissions</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Group Type</b></td>
    <td><b>Folder Level</b></td>
    <td><b>Own</b></td><td><b>Edit</b></td><td><b>Add</b></td><td><b>View</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Group Type A</td>
    <td>[Customer]</td>
    <td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Group Type B</td>
    <td>[Digital Platform]</td>
    <td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Group Type C</td>
    <td>[Roots]</td>
    <td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</p></p>

<b>Owner</b>: Allows the user to create new folders in that folder without forcing inheritance, move the folder, delete the
folder, rename the folder, and change the permissions and inheritance settings on the folder.

</p></p>

<b>Edit</b>: Allows the user to create new folders in that folder, which forces the "Inherit Permissions from Parent" permission
on the new folder, move secrets into that folder, and add new secrets into that folder.

</p></p>

<b>Add Secret</b>: Allows the user to add a secret in that folder. Does not grant access to the added secret.

</p></p>

<b>View</b>: Allows the user to see the folder and secrets in that folder that are inheriting permissions from their folder.


<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">6. Authorization Examples</h4>

The following examples show how access to credentials in specific folders is either granted or denied to an AD user based
upon their membership in an AD group.

</p></p>

<b>6.1 Access Granted</b>

</p></p>

<pre>
curl -X GET -u 'admin\aura_nagios:password' "https://pam.sec.ibm.com/credentials-api/credentials/?folderName=PR0000000041639"
</pre>

</p></p>

<b>6.2 Response</b>

</p></p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</pre>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>User</th><th>Group</th><th>Group Type</th><th>Folder</th><th>Credential Type</th><th>Permission</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>admin\aura_nagios</td><td>AURA_NAGIOS</td><td>Group Type C</td><td>PR0000000041639</td><td>Dynamic</td><td>View</td></tr>
</table>

</p></p>

The <code>admin\aura_nagios</code> user is granted access to all Dynamic credentials in the PR0000000041639 device folder because
the user is a member of group AURA_NAGIOS that is of Group Type C, authorized at a root folder level, from where permissions
<i>cascade down</i> into the lower levels of the folder structure, or, the lower-level PR0000000041639 device folder
<i>inherits</i> permissions from its parent and ancestor folders.

</p></p>

<b>6.3 Access Denied</b>

</p></p>

<pre>
curl -X GET -u 'admin\joe_analyst:password' "https://pam.sec.ibm.com/credentials-api/credentials/?folderName=CID001287"
</pre>


<b>6.4 Response</b>

</p></p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized</pre>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>User</th><th>Group</th><th>Group Type</th><th>Folder</th><th>Credential Type</th><th>Permission</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>admin\joe_analyst</td><td>SOC_ANALYST</td><td>Group Type B</td><td>CID001287</td><td>Static</td><td>None</td></tr>
</table>

</p></p>

The <code>admin\joe_analyst</code> user is denied access to all Static credentials in the CID001287 customer folder because
the user is a member of group SOC_ANALYST that is of Group Type B, placed at a Digital Platform folder level, lower than
the CID001287 customer folder. This arrangement puts the credentials in the CID001287 customer folder  <i>out of scope</i>
for the user, based on their group membership and the group's placement lower in the folder structure.
