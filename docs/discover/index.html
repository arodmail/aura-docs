The discovery step of the PAM on-boarding workflow begins with an assessment of a digital platform, that focuses on
credentials to manage and the access requirements for an MSSP. This assessment explores the access needed, establishes a
purpose for credentials, and examines a remote password change mechanism supported by the digital platform.

</p>

The discovery step completes 5 tasks:

<ol>
    <li>Test Environment
    <li>Credentials Inventory
    <li>Access Requirements
    <li>Password Complexity
    <li>Remote Password Change Mechanism
</ol>

</p>

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">1. Test Environment</h4>

</p>

Gaining access to or setting up a test environment is a recommended first task to begin discovery. A test environment
supports two discovery goals: to explore the digital platform's access control model, and to test a privileged access
management approach in a working environment.

</p>

Any of the following assets may become a test environment:

<ul>
    <li>Virtual Machine</li>
    <li>Bare-metal server hardware</li>
    <li>Cloud-hosted resource</li>
    <li>Lab device</li>
    <li>Small network of any of the above</li>
    <li>Other</li>
</ul>

To support discovery goals, a test environment should be representative of a customer's digital platform to be managed
by AURA.

</p>

<b>Outcome of Task</b>

</p>

<ul><li>Gain access to or setup a working digital platform instance for discovery and testing purposes.</li></ul>

</p>

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">2. Credentials Inventory</h4>

</p>

What elevated credentials are present on a host? In many cases, a <i>superuser</i> may exist, such as "root",
"admin", or "administrator", which are special accounts used for system administration purposes. These are user accounts
capable of making unrestricted, system-wide changes. Other, ordinary accounts granted less than superuser privileges,
in some cases exist to run processes as functional accounts. This step in the assessment of a digital platform takes
inventory of special and ordinary accounts already present, that need to come under management by AURA.

</p>

<b>Outcome of Task</b>

</p>

<ul>
    <li>Discover and compile a list of credentials (usernames and passwords) that exist on the host, OS, application,
        device, or customer asset to manage.
    </li>
</ul>


<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">2.1 Sample Credentials Inventory</h4>

The following 2 accounts are identified as being present on the host or in the environment, as a standard out-of-box
configuration. In this summary, each account is enumerated, and its purpose stated.

</p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Credential Name</th><th>Credential Purpose</th><th>Login Name</th><th>Access Level</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>Root</td><td>A root account used for system administration purposes</td><td>root</td><td>Administrative</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Guest</td><td>A guest account</td><td>guest</td><td>User</td></tr>
</table>

</p>

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">3. Access Requirements</h4>

</p>

What elevated credentials are missing or need to be created? While pre-defined credentials for different purposes are often
included out-of-box in a digital platform, application, OS, or on a device to be managed, additional credentials often need
to be defined and added for different monitoring and administration purposes. For example, in order to administer a device in a basic
way, SOC Analysts often share one or more sets of credentials with admin-level privileges.

</p>

An assessment of access requirements during discovery provides an understanding of the digital platform from the
perspective of an MSSP: to manage and service a host, device, or other customer asset, what access to the
digital platform is required? What credentials and permissions granted to them allow the MSSP to provide its services?
For example, to perform authenticated health checks on a device, a dedicated functional account is created for this purpose
and must be granted sufficient rights or privileges within the platform to login remotely and to perform a health check.

</p>
In addition to monitoring and administration purposes, accounts may be defined and added into the digital platform for other
purposes such as:

<ul>
    <li>Automation</li>
    <li>Backups</li>
    <li>Integration</li>
    <li>Data acquisition</li>
    <li>Auditing</li>
</ul>

</p>

A credential added into the digital platform to be managed by AURA, must belong to one of the following
4 categories:

</p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>&nbsp;</th><th>Category</th><th>Description</th><th>RPC Required</th><th>Auto Change</th><th>Check-Out Enabled</th><th>Credentials Manager</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>Dynamic</td><td>Enabled for check-in/out, supports automated remote password rotation </td>
        <td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>Static</td><td>A vaulted credential, does not change frequently or automatically </td>
        <td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>Controlled</td><td>Stored securely, supports manual password rotation </td>
        <td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>Functional</td><td>Like static, but supports automated remote password rotation </td>
        <td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr>
</table>

</p>

<b>Note:</b> <i>Auto Change</i> automatically initiates a password change after a Credential expires.

</p>

<b>Note:</b> Check-Out Enabled: <b>Yes</b>, suggests use of the credential <i>by a person</i> because it gives a person
exclusive access to (locks) the credential until Check-In. Check-Out Enabled: <b>No</b> is almost always reserved for use
<i>by an application</i>, or headless access to a credential.

</p>

<b>Outcome of Task</b>

<ul>
    <li>Create a list of credentials that are missing from the digital platform to manage.</li>
    <li>Summarize privileges to grant to each credential (e.g., membership in a group) for automation or remote
        administration purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">3.1 Sample Access Requirements</h4>

As an example, let's say the following 4 credentials are required to be added into a digital platform for monitoring and administration
purposes. In this summary, each account is enumerated, and its purpose established. The credential category determines if
the password for a credential is subject to automated rotation by RPC upon use, or only vaulted securely by AURA.

</p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Credential Name</th><th>Credential Purpose</th><th>Credential Category</th><th>Login Name</th><th>Access Level</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>Root Login</td><td>Used for password management purposes on behalf of other users</td><td>Dynamic</td><td>svcmss</td><td>Root</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SOC Root</td><td>Used by SOC Analysts to login for administration purposes</td><td>Dynamic</td><td>admin1</td><td>Administrative</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SOC Root Backup</td><td>A secondary account for SOC Analysts</td><td>Dynamic</td><td>admin2</td><td>Administrative</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Health Checker</td><td>Used by Nagios for authenticated health checks</td><td>Static</td><td>monitor-user</td><td>Read-Only</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Backups CLI</td><td>Used to transfer backup files securely from the host</td><td>Functional</td><td>backup-user</td><td>Backups-Only</td></tr>
</table>

</p>

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">4. Password Complexity</h4>

</p>

How strong are passwords in the digital platform? Because password strength is a requirement for most accounts, and the
rules to generate a valid password may vary from one digital platform to another, discovery also gathers the requirements
for account password complexity. Passwords should be strong enough to withstand a brute-force attack, such as a
dictionary attack.

</p>

To defy attacks and to prevent guessing, strong passwords are based upon rules. This step in discovery provides
an understanding of the rules that govern password complexity in the digital platform. Requirements for strong passwords
include:

</p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Requirement</th><th>Description</th><th>MSS Standard</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Minimum Length</td><td>Must be at least n characters</td><td>Must be at least 15 characters</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Maximum Length</td><td>Must be at most n characters</td><td>Must be at most 26 characters</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Character Set</td><td>Must contain only lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and symbols</td>
        <td>Categories: A through Z / a through z / 0 through 9 / ! $ # %</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Password Rules</td><td>Must use n lower case letters, n upper case letters, at least n numbers, and n symbols</td>
        <td>Contain characters from 3 of the 4 character set categories</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Password History</td><td>If enforced, determines the number of unique new passwords that must be associated
        with a user account before an old password can be reused</td><td>Number of passwords to store: 24</td>
    </tr>
</table>

</p>

<b>Outcome of Task</b>

</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create a summary of the rules that govern password complexity in the digital platform.</li>
    <li>Assess whether or not MSS Standard password rules can be enforced.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h4 class="uk-h4 tm-heading-fragment">5. Remote Password Change Mechanism</h4>

</p></p>

What is the remote password change mechanism supported by the digital platform? Most systems that recognize any form of
remote login also provide a mechanism, a protocol, an API, or other means to change a password on an interactive login
account remotely. For user accounts, changing passwords regularly (password rotation and expiration) provides assurances
that if a password is ever disclosed to others, then it cannot be used for any length of time. PAM provides greater
security by requiring passwords for shared accounts to change upon each use.

</p>

During discovery, the mechanism supported by the digital platform to change passwords remotely on privileged and ordinary
accounts is examined and understood. Because change-password operations require that the user's current password be known
before the change is allowed, discovery also takes into consideration how to obtain current password values from a
credentials inventory.

</p>

Key questions to answer during discovery about an RPC mechanism:

<ul>
    <li>What is the network protocol used by RPC? For example, SSH or REST?</li>
    <li>What account attributes are required to perform a password change?</li>
    <li>Does the platform support self-service password resets?</li>
    <li>Are password changes only allowed to be performed by a "superuser" account?</li>
</ul>

<b>Outcome of Task</b>

<ul>
    <li>Answer key questions</li>
    <li>Successfully perform a remote password change on an account</li>
    <li>Take notes on the RPC mechanism, use the test environment, capture the commands executed or the APIs called</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="uk-h3 tm-heading-fragment">6. Discovery Summary</h3>

The following outcomes are expected from discovery tasks:

<ol>
    <li>Gain access to or setup a working digital platform instance for PAM tests</li>
    <li>Compile a list of credentials (usernames and passwords) that exist in the digital platform. </li>
    <li>Create a list of credentials (usernames and account types) that are missing from
        the digital platform based upon access requirements.</li>
    <li>Create a summary of the rules that govern password complexity in the digital platform. </li>
